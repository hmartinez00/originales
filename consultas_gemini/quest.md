Is dark chocolate a healthy treat?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,000
Happily, the answer is yes.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Why?

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,680
Dark chocolate is a good source of magnesium,

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,800
which helps regulate muscle and nerve function

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,920
and blood sugar levels.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
One ounce can have about the same amount of fiber

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,520
as a small apple.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,780
Much of the fat in dark chocolate is a combo

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,040
of heart-healthy monosaturated fat and stearic acid,

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,720
a type of saturated fat that doesn't raise cholesterol.

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,020
Also, dark chocolate can be really low in added sugars.

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,300
And, cacao contains flavanols.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,180
These antioxidants in dark chocolate

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,740
may help improve blood flow,

16
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,140
reduce inflammation, and lower cholesterol.

17
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,020
And the darker the chocolate, the better.

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,940
Look for high levels of cacao and bits of nuts and fruit

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,980
that can help balance any bitterness.

20
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,580
Dark chocolate is a habit you won't wanna break.
